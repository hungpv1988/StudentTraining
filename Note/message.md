I've done add some new `IValidationRule` for each school. Is it about extending `interface` and letting `ServiceLocator` do the job?

However, I don't feel like moving forward at all.

I have been reading about setting up Episerver Alloy sample and _Definition of Done_ in  your slide.

So what's next?
