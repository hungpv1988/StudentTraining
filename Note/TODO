3. For all universities, administrators should be able to disable rules or enables rules.

	- Developers should be able to create new rules or remove old ones and admin should be able to manage rules.
		- Ideas:
			- `GetBusinessRules()` will returns all the rules are in effect.
			- `GetIgnoreRules()` will returns all the rules are being ignored.
			- Add `Description` field to each rules for the administrator
			- Identify all rules by `FullName` (I don't think administrator should care about the `FullName`
			- Create a `View` list all the rules with their active status.
			- Somehow store the admistrator's configuration at runtime and ...

4. If possible, code one view using React.

Note: code as you do, and review your code, and refactor

Stick to SOLID principles.
